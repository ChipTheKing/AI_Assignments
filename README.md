AI Assignment 02:
To implement Uniform Cost-Search, Best-First Search, and
A* algorithm, respectively to solve the 8-puzzle problem.

The 8-puzzle problem consists of 8 numbered, movable tiles set
in a 3x3 frame. One cell is always empty thus making it possible
to move an adjacent numbered tile into the empty cell. Such a
puzzle is shown below:

        [1, 2, 3]                       [2, 8, 3]
        [8,  , 4]           <--         [1, 6, 4]
        [7, 6, 5]                       [7,  , 5]

In my program the blank space will be filled with the value 0
as a placeholder in the list.
